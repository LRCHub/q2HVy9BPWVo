Space boy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free

Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moon dust will cover you
Cover you

This chaos is killing me

So bye, bye love
Yeah bye, bye love
Bye, bye love
Yeah bye, bye love

This chaos is killing me

Hallo space boy, you're sleepy now
You're silhouette, so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free

Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moon dust will cover you
Cover you

And the chaos is killing me

Yeah bye, bye love
So bye, bye love
Yeah bye, bye love
So bye, bye love

This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me

Yeah bye, bye love
Bye, bye love
Eternal
Sweet, sweet love
Bye bye space boy
Bye, bye love

Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you
